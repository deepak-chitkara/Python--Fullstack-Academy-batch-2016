"""

A robot moves in a plane starting from the origin point (0,0). The robot can move UP , DOWN , LEFT , RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of the robot movement is shown as: 
 			   UP 5 
 			   DOWN 3 
 			   LEFT 3 
 			   RIGHT 2  
 			   i->number

The number after the directions  are the steps. Write a program to compute the distance from the current position after a sequence of movement and the original point. If the distance is a float then print the nearest integer.

SAMPLE INPUT :
               UP 5
               DOWN 3
 	       LEFT 3
 	       RIGHT 2


SAMPLE OUTPUT :
               2
